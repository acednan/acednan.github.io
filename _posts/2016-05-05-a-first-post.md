I have been planning to write a blog for a really long time now. And I always imagine myself having the perfect blog with the perfect blogging framework and the perfect theme. But, I am not a perfectionist, and yet I fall into this trap of "Analysis Paralysis". 

After I started using the RubyOnRails (popularly known as ROR) framework, the choice became a lot more simple. I narrowed it down to Jekyll. I started looking at themes: Lanyon and [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) were the most appealing. Settled on Minimal Mistakes. After a while, I remembered about this other blogging framework called Octopress. I knew it was a fork from Jekyll, but decided to check it anyway. Although, it seemed more "Ruby"-like, I was not convinced. So I decided to try the Minimal Mistakes theme with vanilla Jekyll. Maybe, if I hit enough bumps with this combination, I might start this up on Octopress. But then there is migration. Always a pain! Aah well, we will just have to wait and watch. Also, [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) seems interesting. 

So, to introduce my blog, well I will mostly be blogging about stuff related to technology, software development, travel, photography and any other thing which may catch my fancy. Also, books. Let the fun begin!

```ruby
def print_seize_the_day
	puts "Carpe Diem!"
end
print_seize_the_day
#Carpe Diem!
```
